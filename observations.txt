5.  Observations against two dumb bots:
    Nothing interesting of note, it was just like fighting our own dumb bots.
    
6.  Observations against enemy smart bots one the four L's map:
    At first we were losing, then we started coming back as their bots got stuck on obstacles.
    Shoot themselves a lot.
    Trapped by objects/don't go around.
    Sinusoidal pattern instead of going straight to the goal (which is good for dodging)
    Don't shoot at enemies, on a timer.
    Sometimes circle the target region.
    Repulsive fields aren't very strong.
    May be repulsed by own shots, which may be causing the sinusoidal pattern above.
    They sometimes crash into the wall of the map, not a huge issue, but annoying.
    Our robots are useless when chasing down our captured flag because we shoot all other bots in persuit.
    Our robots get distracted from capturing flags when our own flag is captured.
    The sinusoidal pattern was due to our visualization, which slowed down the frequency of updating.  This wasn't an issue on the second match.
    
    On the four boxes map:
    We tried to fight two of our agents against two of theirs.
    Our opponents attraction fields put their attraction fields on all flags. We saw that this caused them to crash into the center obstacles.
