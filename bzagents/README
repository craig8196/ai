To compile bots to .pyc (to hide the code from students), run:

python -m compileall -lf .
mv *.pyc compiled/

Then to run a bot, use:

./compiled/blind.py [bot_name] [host] [port]

As of 3/19/2010, the agents in this folder (TA Agents?) are ranked in order of
difficulty/sophistication.  The higher the number, the better the bot.  There
should also be a comment at the top of each agent file describing what its
basic capabilities are.
