BSFlag Data
===========

Most of the images here are stolen straight from BZFlag.  This is a good
thing because it keeps the appearances as similar as possible.  The exception
is the tank images.  Since BZFlag doesn't have a simple image for each tank, I
created tank.svg in Inkscape.  I exported this same tank with four different
colors to get the tank images.
